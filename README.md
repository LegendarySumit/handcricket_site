🏏 Hand Cricket: A Nostalgic Mini-Game 🏏
Hand Cricket is a classic childhood game brought to life on the web! This project is a simple yet engaging web-based version of the hand cricket game we all played with our friends in school. It's built as a fun, solo project to sharpen my frontend development skills.

✨ Features
Player vs. Computer: Take on a simple AI that learns from your recent moves.

Customizable Match: Set your desired number of overs and wickets.

Innings System: Play two complete innings, just like a real cricket match.

Scoreboard: Track your score, the computer's score, and the match status in real-time.

Responsive Design: Playable on both desktop and mobile devices.

💻 Technologies Used
HTML: For the game structure and layout.

CSS : For all the styling, including the cool-looking buttons and interface.

JavaScript: For all the game logic, state management, and DOM manipulation.

🕹️ How to Play
Set the Rules: Choose the number of wickets and overs you want to play.

Toss: A coin toss decides who bats first.

Batting: When batting, you select a number (1-6). If the computer throws the same number, you are OUT! Your score is the sum of all the runs you've scored.

Bowling: When bowling, the computer will bat. If you throw the same number as the computer, the computer is OUT!

Target: In the second innings, the team batting needs to chase the target set by the first team.

Win/Loss/Tie: The game ends when all wickets fall or the overs run out.

🧠 Project Challenges & Learnings
This was a fantastic learning experience! While the concept seems simple, making the game fully functional required a lot of debugging and logical problem-solving. Some of the key challenges included:

State Management: Keeping track of scores, wickets, overs, and whose turn it is.

Game Loop Logic: Ensuring the game transitions smoothly between innings and handles all win/loss conditions correctly.

UI Updates: Dynamically updating the scoreboard and game messages in real-time without glitches.

I'm also a big believer in using modern tools, and this project was a great opportunity to lean on generative AI models for assistance. They were invaluable in helping me debug complex logical errors and brainstorm elegant solutions, proving that AI can be a powerful collaborator in the development process.
